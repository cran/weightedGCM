Description: A conditional independence test that can be applied both to
    univariate and multivariate random variables. The test is based on a
    weighted form of the sample covariance of the residuals after a
    nonlinear regression on the conditioning variables. Details are
    described in Scheidegger, Hoerrmann and Buehlmann (2021) "The Weighted
    Generalised Covariance Measure" <arXiv:2111.04361>. The test is a
    generalisation of the Generalised Covariance Measure (GCM) implemented
    in the R package 'GeneralisedCovarianceMeasure' by Jonas Peters and
    Rajen D. Shah based on Shah and Peters (2020) "The Hardness of
    Conditional Independence Testing and the Generalised Covariance
    Measure" <arXiv:1804.07203>.
